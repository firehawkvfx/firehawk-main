# This process archives secrets.  they are copied to the secrets/ path, and encrypted by the vault id - keys/.vault-key
# Nothing stored in the secrets path should be unencrypted. normally, .tfstate files are in the git ignore and will not be commited to the repository.
# so after a commit, if you run a terraform apply, you should also runf store-tfstate.yaml and commit the secrets to the repository.
